        <h1>London</h1>

        <p>London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom. For two millennia, it was a large town and its history goes back to its foundation by the Romans, when it was named Londínio. The center of London, the former City of London, also known as The Square Mile ("the square mile") or The City, maintains its medieval borders. At least since the 19th century, the name "London" has referred to the metropolis developed around this nucleus. Today, most of this conurbation forms the Greater London region, whose administrative area has its own elected mayor and assembly.</p>
